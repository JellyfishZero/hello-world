# hello-world
//This is my first time to use this website!!

/*
Hi! I have created the "hello world". And then, I want to introduce myself.
I'm a National Pingtung University (Taiwan) studnet, and I major in "Imformation Management".
My coding experience isn't long, just one year. 
During a year, I learn "C" first, and C#, C++. Recently, I start to leran java.
My English ability isnot very well, but I hope I can learn much new knowledge on this web.

By the way, I love Japanese animation and games. Just like "Kancolle", and battleship "Bismarck" is mywife.

In the future, I want to be a video game designer (or programer). 
Finally, I want to lead a team to build the best game of the world, and to be the famous game designer, 
just like my idol "Hideo Kojima" san.
This is my dream of life.

Thanks.
